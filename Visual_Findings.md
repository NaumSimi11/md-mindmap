in the sidebar ( context / outline )
: the outline - when we click on something - we should get navigated there . - not working nice

- in the context - we create a folder - and then we press upload ( when the uploader upens, we can select multiple documents, but only 1 gets uploaded ) we should fix this. 
- the header of the created folder section - should contain + button to add more documents to the folder , maybe exist but i cant see it right now, so check the design there. 

in the floating bar, the last icon is an additional menu, so we should add icon ... ( 3 dots ) instead of keybaiord :) 

we should remove the Prepare Presentation button from the most top bar in the editor

we should think do we need the bar with the text editing tool. 
what we have now , we have 1 bar with tools (format , diagram , ai assistant and so on) and 1 bar with text editing tools (bold, italic, underline, etc) , we should think if we need both of them. 

we should also make analyze how the sidebar ( all docs ) works now. what if we are in the web version and we open the sidebar - we should see all docs in the sidebar?? or if we are logged in?? or only logged in user can do something ???

also we should start thinking on the landing page. at this moment landing page differs a lil bit of our design.  i dont know if we need that landing page or not ( i think its' nice as a sell point or whatever ) .

we should also think about the pricing. at this moment we have a free plan and a paid plan. but we should think about the pricing. 

We should remove "Blocks Demo" button from the sidebar



I Got the aws account - and i got the domain. so we should think now for the backend - synchronization ( online - offline ( web / tauri )) , and also we should think about the pricing. keep in mind, most important think should be the collaboration. how the collaboration will work, what we will use for seemless collaboration, what are our strengts.. 

how we goona handle auth ?

who can invite ppl ( do we ave magic link, does that link least only while the user is there)... 

so we keep in mind all that thing. and we do analyze them 1 buy 1.

your job is not to make a deeep deep analyze on this file, and tell me if we can move on with the brainstorming on each of this fields. 

we should sell with our ai inside, or user can add his own tokens for ai assistance?


and yea, u can continue this list as much as u think there is a space for it . 

in the editor , when we add block quites ( that looks nice ) . an we change color on each quote? 


we should add insert table in the floating meny too and when we pressit some bouble meny should appear so we can select what kind of table we want ( how big table we want to be ) .
