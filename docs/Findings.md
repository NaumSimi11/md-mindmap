EDITOR FINDINGS ! 
we need to be able to change font ( on selected whatever)
we need to be able to resize any diagram ( we have proble mwith the size of them now )
we need to be able when we select all text from the editor, and we generate some diagram and we press insert , ( to insert thre generated diagram in the editor) , the diagram is inserted in the editor, but all the data is deleted ( all text we have preselected to generate the diagram based on that selection) . so we should insert the diagram . 

we should investigate how our outline ( sidebar ourlines from the text in the editor ) works, and to improve it. now when i select, it's not pointing me in the editor in the exact space ( i dont have it that part from the text in the view exactly. ) also, i thing its not navigationg if we select some part of the ABOVE outlines ! !  ! ! 

in the top bar now we have : 
bUTTONS : Format , FORMAT ( double, merge functionalities maybe we dont need 2 buttons. so merge functionalities and make the dropdowns more beaurifull and creative. we need to boost the user creativity in this application !!! )
Diagram, ai, Mindmap, Autocomplete ( chip ) , Ai hints ( chip ) Mark down , undo, redo, Label ( button ) for the name of the document and 3 dots menu. 
here we should do the following changes ( and think - brainstorm more for the feature enchantments ) : remove thre anem label ( button ) - we have it in the top BAR. 
WE NEED to check what the chips are doing and how they differe betweeen each other and see what we do nbexrt with them. 

when i paste some md content, if we are in wys it shows me as we did it. if we want to show the actuall beauty of this md files, we managed to go in the markdown , then paste, then go back to wys so we can see how it looks formated. 

cant we trigger this on paste? we should make advanced . we have this problem that should make a big analyzis. 

ON Each problem - we add things! we first do analyze on each of them, then we do reacting on it! 

we need to be able to rename ( see ) the document in the top bar, where we have the log ( MD Reader / document name) so we dont have to fuck up the name arround in the ui anymore elsewhere.
