- Smooth animation (20ms intervals)
- Configurable speed (default: 3 characters per interval)
- Animated cursor (|) while streaming
- Auto-completes and removes cursor when done

## 🎬 **HOW IT LOOKS:**

### **BEFORE (Instant):**
```
You: "What should we add to stakeholders?"
     ↓
AI:  [ENTIRE MESSAGE APPEARS AT ONCE]
     "Got it! Let's dive into the customer aspect...
      1. Customer Feedback Mechanisms
      2. Customer Personas
      3. Engagement Strategies
      ..."
```

### **AFTER (Streaming):**
```
You: "What should we add to stakeholders?"
     ↓
AI:  "Got it! Let's div|"
     ↓ (streaming...)
AI:  "Got it! Let's dive into the customer aspect o|"
     ↓ (streaming...)
AI:  "Got it! Let's dive into the customer aspect of your stakeholders. Here are some idea|"
     ↓ (streaming...)
AI:  "Got it! Let's dive into the customer aspect of your stakeholders. Here are some ideas we could explore:

      1. Customer Feedback Mechanisms
      2. Customer Personas|"
     ↓ (streaming...)
AI:  [FULL MESSAGE, CURSOR DISAPPEARS]
     "Got it! Let's dive into the customer aspect of your stakeholders. Here are some ideas we could explore:

      1. Customer Feedback Mechanisms: How will you gather feedback...
      2. Customer Personas: What different types of customers...
      3. Engagement Strategies: What strategies will you use...
      4. Satisfaction Metrics: How will you measure...
      5. Support and Communication Channels: What channels...

      Do any of these resonate with you?"
```

## ⚙️ **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Component: StreamingText.tsx**
```typescript
interface StreamingTextProps {
  text: string;        // Full text to display
  speed?: number;      // Characters per interval (default: 2)
  onComplete?: () => void; // Callback when done
}
```

### **How It Works:**
1. Receives full text as prop
2. Starts with empty `displayedText`
3. Every 20ms, adds `speed` characters
4. Shows animated cursor (|) while streaming
5. Removes cursor when complete
6. Calls `onComplete` callback (if provided)

### **Speed Settings:**
- `speed={1}` - Slow (1 char every 20ms)
- `speed={2}` - Normal (2 chars every 20ms) - default
- `speed={3}` - Fast (3 chars every 20ms) - **current**
- `speed={5}` - Very fast (5 chars every 20ms)

---

## 🎨 **UI FEATURES:**

### **Animated Cursor:**
```tsx
{currentIndex < text.length && (
  <span className="inline-block w-1 h-4 bg-purple-500 ml-0.5 animate-pulse">|</span>
)}
```
- Purple vertical bar (|)
- Pulsing animation
- Only shows while streaming
- Disappears when done

### **Integration:**
```tsx
{msg.role === 'ai' ? (
  <StreamingText 
    text={msg.content} 
    speed={3}
  />
) : (
  msg.content  // User messages show instantly
)}
```
