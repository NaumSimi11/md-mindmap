# ✅ AI Wiring - COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 FIXED AND READY TO SHIP

---

## 🎉 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **The Bug:**
`handleAIAction` had an empty dependency array `[]`, causing **stale closures**.

### **The Fix:**
Added all 5 AI handler functions to the dependency array.

**File:** `src/pages/MindmapStudio2.tsx`  
**Line:** 2142-2148

**Before:**
```typescript
}, []); // ❌ Empty - causes stale closures
```

**After:**
```typescript
}, [
  handleSmartExpandAll,
  handleAutoConnect,
  handleReorganize,
  handleGoalGeneration,
  handleQualityAudit,
]); // ✅ Fixed - always uses latest versions
```
