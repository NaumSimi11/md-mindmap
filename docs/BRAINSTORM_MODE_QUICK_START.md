## 💡 **TIPS & TRICKS**

### **Getting Started:**
1. **Ask open-ended questions:**
   - "Help me plan a product launch"
   - "I want to organize my research"
   - "How should I structure this project?"

2. **Be conversational:**
   - AI will ask follow-up questions
   - Answer naturally
   - Share constraints (budget, time, team size)

3. **Refine through dialogue:**
   - "That's too broad, narrow it down"
   - "Focus on the marketing part"
   - "What about small teams with no budget?"

4. **Commit when ready:**
   - Say "add it" or "create nodes"
   - AI extracts main topics from conversation
   - Nodes appear on canvas!

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"AI is not asking questions, just executing"**
→ Make sure you're in **💬 Brainstorm** mode (button should be white)

### **"I said 'add it' but nothing happened"**
→ AI might not have detected the phrase. Try:
   - "add these to the mindmap"
   - "create nodes"
   - "yes add"

### **"I want to switch modes mid-conversation"**
→ Just click the other mode button! Your conversation is preserved.

### **"How do I clear the conversation?"**
→ Just say "add it" to commit nodes - conversation context clears automatically!

## 🎉 **YOU'RE READY!**

**Go to Studio2 → Click AI icon → Start brainstorming!**

**Remember:**
- 💬 **Brainstorm** = Conversation, exploration, refinement
- ⚡ **Command** = Instant execution, speed, precision

**Both modes work together perfectly!** 🚀
