# 📋 Editor Findings - Status Update

## ✅ FIXED (Just Now!)

### 1. **Document Title in Top Bar** ✅
- **Issue**: "we need to be able to rename (see) the document in the top bar"
- **Status**: **FIXED!**
- **What we did**:
  - Removed duplicate title from editor toolbar
  - Added editable inline input in top bar (MD Creator / [Document Name])
  - Auto-saves on change
  - Clean, simple UX

### 2. **Paste Markdown Content with Diagrams** ✅
- **Issue**: "when i paste some md content, if we are in wys it shows me as we did it... cant we trigger this on paste?"
- **Status**: **FIXED!**
- **What we did**:
  - Fixed paste handler to detect markdown with mermaid diagrams
  - Extracts and renders mermaid diagrams automatically on paste
  - Updates outline immediately after paste
  - Changed from chained commands to array-based insertion (fixes TipTap rejection bug)

### 3. **Mode Switching with Diagrams** ✅
- **Issue**: Diagrams disappear when switching between WYSIWYG ↔ Markdown modes
- **Status**: **FIXED!**
- **What we did**:
  - Fixed `parseAndInsertMarkdown` to use array-based insertion
  - Diagrams now persist when switching modes
  - Markdown code is preserved correctly
  - Full round-trip: WYSIWYG → Markdown → WYSIWYG works!

### 4. **Outline Sync on Paste** ✅
- **Issue**: Outline wasn't updating when pasting content in WYSIWYG mode
- **Status**: **FIXED!**
- **What we did**:
  - Added manual `onContentChange` call after paste completes
  - Outline now populates immediately after paste
  - Content is correctly converted to markdown for outline parsing

### 5. **Infinite Loop Bug** ✅
- **Issue**: Console spamming, app freezing
- **Status**: **FIXED!**
- **What we did**:
  - Removed `onTitleChange` from useEffect dependency array
  - Prevented callback re-creation from triggering infinite loops

## ⚠️ NEEDS WORK

### 1. **Font Selection** 🔴
- **Issue**: "we need to be able to change font (on selected whatever)"
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **What we have**: `FontFamilyDropdown` component exists but needs testing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 2. **Diagram Resizing** 🟡
- **Issue**: "we need to be able to resize any diagram (we have problem with the size of them now)"
- **Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **What we have**: 
  - Inline resize controls (Edit, -, %, +, Fit) already exist in `MermaidNode.tsx`
  - Drag-resize handle implemented
  - "Full Width" button available
- **What's missing**: Needs testing and possibly better UX
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 3. **Diagram Insert Without Text Deletion** 🔴
- **Issue**: "when we select all text from the editor, and we generate some diagram and we press insert, the diagram is inserted in the editor, but all the data is deleted"
- **Status**: NOT FIXED
- **Root cause**: When text is selected and we insert content, it replaces the selection instead of inserting after it
- **Solution needed**: Change insertion logic to insert *after* current selection, not replace it
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. **Outline Click-to-Scroll Accuracy** 🔴
- **Issue**: "when i select, it's not pointing me in the editor in the exact space"
- **Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING
- **What we have**: 
  - ScrollSpy is currently **disabled** (to prevent infinite loops)
  - `scrollToTextInEditor` function exists but may not be accurate
- **What's missing**: 
  - Re-enable ScrollSpy with proper loop prevention
  - Improve scroll positioning (needs to account for toolbar height, etc.)
  - Test outline navigation for items "ABOVE"
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 5. **Toolbar Cleanup** 🟡
- **Issue**: "Format, FORMAT (double, merge functionalities maybe we dont need 2 buttons)"
- **Status**: NEEDS REVIEW
- **What we have**: 
  - `FormatDropdown` (text formatting)
  - `FontFamilyDropdown` (font selection)
  - `AISettingsDropdown` (AI Autocomplete + AI Hints)
- **What's missing**: Check if there are duplicate "Format" buttons and merge them
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 6. **Remove Duplicate Name Label** ✅
- **Issue**: "remove the name label (button) - we have it in the top BAR"
- **Status**: **ALREADY FIXED!** (We removed `InlineDocumentTitle` from toolbar)

### 7. **AI Chips Functionality** 🟡
- **Issue**: "WE NEED to check what the chips are doing and how they differ between each other"
- **Status**: NEEDS ANALYSIS
- **Components**:
  - "Autocomplete" chip → AI Autocomplete toggle
  - "AI hints" chip → AI inline suggestions toggle
- **Action needed**: Test both, document differences, possibly merge into one "AI Assistant" toggle
- **Priority**: LOW
