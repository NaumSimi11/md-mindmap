# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Testing Guide

## ✅ Fix #1: Diagram Insert Without Deleting Text

### What Was Fixed:
- Changed `insertMermaidDiagram` from using broken `.setMermaid()` chain to array-based insertion
- Diagram now inserts **after** selected text, not replacing it

### How to Test:
1. Open editor and write some text: "Hello world this is my document"
2. Select all text (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
3. Click "Diagram" button and generate a diagram
4. Click "Insert"
5. **Expected**: Diagram appears AFTER your text, text is NOT deleted
6. **Previous Bug**: Text was deleted and only diagram remained

### Code Changed:
- File: `src/components/editor/WYSIWYGEditor.tsx`
- Function: `insertMermaidDiagram`
- Lines: 812-834

## ✅ Fix #2: Outline Click-to-Scroll (Already Implemented)

### Current Status:
- Scroll function already exists and looks comprehensive
- Uses TipTap's `.scrollIntoView()` + enhanced scroll with offset
- Calculates position to place heading at 1/3 from top of viewport

### How to Test:
1. Paste a document with multiple headings
2. Check that outline populates in sidebar
3. Click on a heading in the outline
4. **Expected**: Editor scrolls smoothly to that heading, positioned nicely in view
5. **If broken**: Check console for logs (🔍 Searching for, ✅ Found heading, etc.)

### Potential Issues:
- If scrolling is inaccurate, might need to adjust offset calculation
- Toolbar height might not be accounted for
- ScrollSpy is currently **disabled** (to prevent infinite loops)

### If Scrolling Doesn't Work:
Check console for:
- `⚠️ Editor instance not available` → Editor ref not set
- `⚠️ Text not found in editor` → Search text doesn't match
- `⚠️ Could not find scrollable parent` → DOM structure issue
